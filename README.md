# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of student performance in math and reading by grade, school, and ultimately, provide the overall district results.  To achieve accurate analysis, we were required to take the Thomas High School 9th grade studentsâ€™ math and reading grades from the data.

# Results
## District Summary Impact
Consdiering that the total of students removed (461) is only 1.2% of the total number of students in the district (39170), the removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders has a minimal impact on the district summary.  
* Average Math Score is reduced by 0.01
* Average reading score is unchanged
* % Passing Math score is reduced by 0.02%
* % Passing Reading is also reduced by 0.02%
* % Overall Passing is reduced by 0.03%

# How does replacing the ninth-grade affect scores by grade
* Math and reading scores by grade  - due to the lack of scores for 9th grade, Thomas High School
* Scores by school spending - because Thomas high school has a better overall schore, the performce by school spending is improved.
* Scores by school size - because Thomas high school has a better overall schore, the performce by school spending is improved.
* Scores by school type - charter school type % passing math, reading and % overall passing scores are increased due to the improved score.

# Summary:  
The removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade scores significantly improved the % passing math, % passing reading and % overall passing scores for the school.  This improvement moved Thomas High School to 2nd place in top performing schools.  The changes also had a smal impact on the district summary, increasing  



###Note to reviewer:  I struggled with this assignment, trying to decide if the total student count should be adjusted for the school summary and the district summary.  I left them as-is because the 9th graders are still in the school, just not their scores.  We did not (were not instructed) to remove them from the student list.
